there are three components to it

1. react frontend
2. backend api written in go
3. elastic search to store the meta data

This is a demo app based on the production version, there are demo images in ./deploy/demo-diagrams and a backup snapshot of the elasticsearch schema at ./deploy/public_examples.jsonif you'd like to get this up and running with non-sensative data.
